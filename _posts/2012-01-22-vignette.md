Currently R can only use Sweave to build package vignettes, so if we want to build vignettes with **knitr**, we have to use some tricks. One way to do this is through a Makefile, which will be used by `R CMD build` when building vignettes. In this Makefile, we can set our rules to create the PDF file using a custom tool like **knitr**.

## How knitr's vignette is built

To illustrate that a Makefile is plausible to build a vignette with **knitr**, this package itself has provided a vignette built with a Makefile; see the [inst/doc/](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/doc) directory for the source code.

The basic idea is to use `Rscript` with an argument `-e` to execute an R expression, and the R code in the Makefile should be self-explanatory. I followed Ross Ihaka's [tutorial](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stat782/downloads/make-tutorial.pdf) and used a variable `PDFS` in the Makefile, so if you want to build more PDF's, you just add their names to `PDFS`.

## When your vignette is not compatible to Sweave

If you want to use the power of **knitr** to build vignettes but unfortunately your syntax is not compatible to Sweave, e.g. `results="hide"` (you should not quote `hide` in Sweave), you still have even darker tricks to cheat R. I hate to mention this, but that is all due to the restriction of R that vignettes must go through Sweave first anyway. The hint is that you can put a fake vignette which is valid to Sweave, then put a real vignette somewhere else. In the Makefile, you copy the real vignette to `./inst/doc/` and run **knitr** on it. After that, you restore the fake vignette as if nothing happened. See the Makefile in the **Rcpp** package for the dark voodoo.

We have appealed to R core for a few times that package authors should be able to decide how to build their vignettes, but this request was always ignored. Long live the voodoo!

## A few comments

Now I tend not to put the real vignettes in my packages for the reasons below:

1. It takes more time to check and compile on CRAN; yes I can turn on cache, but the cache files are like pollution to the package source and I want a clean package;
1. PDF vignettes are often too big compared to other files in the package (e.g. R source code), so I do not want to bring extra burden to our CRAN hosts, knowing that the number of packages has been growing exponentially;
1. I can keep track of the number of downloads when I put them in GitHub whereas I can know little information from CRAN;

So I just went green.

I thank Carl Boettiger, Ross Ihaka and Andrew Redd for their Makefile examples.
