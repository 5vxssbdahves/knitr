We can use any languages in **knitr**, including but not limited to R. Here is a simple demo with Python and Awk:

- source: [knitr-lang.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-lang.Rmd)
- output: [knitr-lang.md](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-lang.md)

These two languages are easy to deal with because they can be called by pure command line, e.g. `python -c` can execute the code passed in as a character string.

The [object](/knitr/objects) `knit_engines` stores a series of named functions to handle code from different languages, and you are free to define a function to deal with a custom language. See [engine.R](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R) for examples on how I deal with Python and Awk.

I do not really know much about other languages, so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/fork_select) more language engines to **knitr**.
