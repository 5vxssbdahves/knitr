We can use any languages in **knitr**, including but not limited to R. Here are some simple demos with Python, Awk, Ruby, Haskell and Bash:

- [python.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/023-engine-python.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/023-engine-python.md))
- [awk.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/024-engine-awk.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/024-engine-awk.md))
- [ruby.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/025-engine-ruby.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/025-engine-ruby.md))
- [haskell.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/026-engine-haskell.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/026-engine-haskell.md))
- [bash.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/027-engine-bash.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/027-engine-bash.md))

These languages are easy to deal with because they can be called by pure command line, e.g. `python -c` can execute the code passed in as a character string.

The `Rcpp` engine is different, however. The C++ code is compiled through the **Rcpp** package. See [Rcpp.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/029-engine-Rcpp.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/029-engine-Rcpp.md)) for example.

The [object](/knitr/objects) `knit_engines` stores a series of named functions to handle code from different languages, and you are free to define a function to deal with a custom language. See [engine.R](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R) for examples on how I deal with Python and Awk.

I do not really know much about other languages, so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/fork_select) more language engines to **knitr**.

Note these languages work not only in markdown, but also in other formats like LaTeX.

Except `engine='R'` (default), all chunks are executed in separate sessions, so the variables cannot be directly shared. If we want to make use of objects created in previous chunks, we usually have to write them to files (as side effects). For the `bash` engine, we can use `Sys.setenv()` to export variables from R to bash ([example](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/061-bash-variable.md)).
