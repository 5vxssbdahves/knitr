We can use any languages in **knitr**, including but not limited to R. Here are some simple demos with Python, Awk, Ruby, Haskell and Bash:

- [python.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/023-engine-python.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/023-engine-python.md))
- [awk.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/024-engine-awk.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/024-engine-awk.md))
- [ruby.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/025-engine-ruby.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/025-engine-ruby.md))
- [haskell.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/026-engine-haskell.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/026-engine-haskell.md))
- [bash.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/027-engine-bash.Rmd) ([output](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/027-engine-bash.md))

These languages are easy to deal with because they can be called by pure command line, e.g. `python -c` can execute the code passed in as a character string.

The [object](/knitr/objects) `knit_engines` stores a series of named functions to handle code from different languages, and you are free to define a function to deal with a custom language. See [engine.R](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R) for examples on how I deal with Python and Awk.

I do not really know much about other languages, so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/fork_select) more language engines to **knitr**.

Note these languages work not only in markdown, but also in other formats like LaTeX.
