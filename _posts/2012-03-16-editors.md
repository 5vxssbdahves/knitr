I have written about [LyX](../lyx/), [RStudio](../rstudio/), [Emacs Org-mode](../org/) and [Eclipse](../eclipse/). There are still other editors that we can use with **knitr**, such as [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and WinEdt. The key is that you call R and load the **knitr** package, then call the function `knit()` or `knit2pdf()`.

## Texmaker

You can define a custom command to process Rnw documents by `User --> User Commands --> Edit User Commands`:

Note if you have not added R's bin path to the `PATH` variable, you need to use the full path to `Rscript.exe` in the above command like:

    "C:/Program Files/R/R-2.14.2/bin/Rscript.exe" -e "knitr::knit2pdf('%.Rnw')"

If you do know where is `Rscript.exe`, simply open R and use `R.home('bin')` to find it. Then for an Rnw document, you can use this `knitr` command to compile it:

Click the arrow on the left to compile the document, and the right arrow to view PDF. Of course the above configuration is for Windows, but it is straightforward for other systems as well: change `Rscript.exe` to `Rscript` (in fact you can use `Rscript` under Windows as well).

## WinEdt

The WinEdt mode [R-Sweave](http://www.winedt.org/Config/modes/R-Sweave.php) supports **knitr** now. Please read on if you want to configure WinEdt by yourself instead.

The following instructions were from [Phil Chalmers](https://github.com/philchalmers), and I did not test them at all, but I feel it should be in the ballpark.

1. Go to `Options -> Execution Modes -> PDFTeXify`. Then look for executable `Rscript.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\R\R-2.14.2\bin\Rscript.exe`) and select that.
2. under `Switches` put `-e`, and under `Parameters` put `"knitr::knit2pdf('%n%t')"`

Now hitting `F9` will run everything for you at once, including opening up the PDF.

Thanks, Phil.

## Emacs/ESS

Simon Potter has [an Emacs lisp script](http://sjp.co.nz/posts/emacs-ess-knitr/) which supports **knitr** and you might want to try it. [lucialam](https://constantmindmapping.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/knitr-and-emacs/) also has a post about Emacs/**knitr**.

## TextMate

See [#252](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/252#issuecomment-6034068) for one approach with Applescript for TextMate 2.

## TeXShop

It is easy to configure [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) to work with **knitr**; just save the code below as a file `Knitr.engine` under the `Engines` directory of TeXShop (usually `~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/`):

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/texbin:/usr/local/bin
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('$1')"
latexmk -pdf "${1%.*}"
{% endhighlight %}

## Tinn-R

Tinn-R started to support **knitr** since v2.3.7.3.
